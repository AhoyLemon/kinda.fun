      h2 💀 YOU DIED OF A DRUG OVERDOSE 💀
      p It feels good until it suddenly doesn't. The stresses of building a megachurch empire have had their effect on your body and mind, and it's not like you have the ability to #[em not] take all the drugs you own. You are an addict, afterall.
      p But hey, #[strong congratultions] on preacing successfully enough to afford a fatal amount of spice. That's an accompliishment in itself.
      //- p And now you're dead.
      //- p But hey, at least you got high in the process!
      //- //- p The stress of running an illegal megachurch empire while evading federal authorities has taken its toll. You succumbed to a fatal overdose of spice.
    template(v-if="my.gameOverCause === 'prison'")
      h2 🏛️ YOU ARE IN PRISON 🏛️
      p The federal investigation into your megachurch empire has concluded, and you have been sentenced to prison for your crimes.

    template(v-if="!my.church.isFounded")
      p It's a shame that you never even got your Megachurch off the ground. The game is called #[strong Megachurch Tycoon] after all.
        span(v-if="!my.hasVan") And you didn't even get a van.
        span(v-else-if="my.chats.sterling.hasContacted") Maybe Sterling could have helped you out with that.
        span(v-else) You did manage to get a van, you should have held on just a little bit longer.

    p(v-if="!my.van") If you'd bought the van from Harold, you'd be able to preach in new places. And after a couple days of that, you'd probably have met somebody new.
