  //"These parties always have impressive spreads that spared no expense; figs from the middle east, the fresh caviar from Russia, and freshly baked pastries from France. All garbage for peasants. This cheese log is the true treasure."
  "On the other side of the room you notice a few snacks: Some croissants, potato chips, deviled eggs: This is all garbage for peasants. But among this trash you notice a cheese log, and this is your mission. You <i>must</i> get to this cheese log",
  "One of the reasons you so enjoy crashing parties like this is because there's often decent snacks. This time though? This time they have a cheese log. You must have it.",

  "It was just your regular impersonator party, packed to the brim with photocopies of the who's who. But over there, you saw her. 3 inches in diameter, 7 inches in length for a voluptious volume of 49.48 packed full of the finest cheese available. That cheese log was the real treasure of the party, and you NEED it.",
