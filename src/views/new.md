# How to Add a New Game to Kinda Fun

This guide explains the steps to create a new game page in the Kinda Fun platform, including all required files and configuration changes.

---

## 1. Create Game Files

First, create a new folder for your game in `src/views/` named after your game (e.g. `src/views/rothko/`). Place all the following files inside this new folder:

- `[Game].vue` — Main Vue component (logic, imports, setup)
- `[Game].pug` — Pug template for the game UI
- `[Game].scss` — SCSS file for game-specific styles
- `Page.pug` — The static page template for HTML output (required for build scripts)

**Example structure:**

- `src/views/[game]/[Game].vue`
- `src/views/[game]/[Game].pug`
- `src/views/[game]/[Game].scss`
- `src/views/[game]/Page.pug`

You must also create:

- Entry file: `src/entries/[game].js` (required; see below for structure)

**Note:** You do not need to manually create `[game].html` in the project root. This file will be automatically generated by the build script (`build-pages.js`).

---

## 2. Create the Entry File

Create `src/entries/[game].js` (replace `[game]` with your game name). This file should import your Vue component and mount it. Example:

```js
import { createApp } from "vue";
import [Game] from "../views/[game]/[Game].vue";
app.mount("#app");
```

If your game needs plugins (like VueFire, Toast, etc.), use the structure from an existing entry file such as `src/entries/cameo.js` or `src/entries/guillotine.js` as a reference.

---

## 3. Register the Game in Vite

Open `vite.config.js` and add a new entry for your game:

```js

// ...existing code...
export default defineConfig({
// ...
build: {
  rollupOptions: {
    input: {
      [game]: resolve(__dirname, 'src/entries/[game].js'),
    },
  }
});

```

---

## 3. Add Build Script Support

### a. `scripts/npm-run/build-pages.js`

- Add a new entry to the `pages` array for your game:

```js
const pages = [
  // ...existing games...
  {
    src: path.join(SRC_DIR, "views", "[game]", "Page.pug"),
    out: path.join(DIST_DIR, "[game].html"),
    name: "[game].html",
  },
];
```

### b. `scripts/npm-run/watch-pages.js`

- Add a new watcher object to the `watchers` array:

```js
const watchers = [
  // ...existing games...
  { name: "[game]", color: "yourColor", file: "src/views/[game]/Page.pug", build: "[game]" },
];
```

If you want to include your game in a sitemap or navigation, update `scripts/update-sitemap.js` or similar.

---

## 4. Test Your Game

- Run `npm run dev` and visit `http://localhost:5173/[game]` to test the new game page.
- Run `npm run build` and check that `dist/[game].html`, `dist/[game].js`, and `dist/[game].css` are created.

---

## 5. (Optional) Add Documentation

- Add a markdown file in `docs/` (e.g., `docs/[game].md`) to document your game for contributors.

---

## Summary Checklist

- [ ] Create `.vue`, `.pug`, `.scss`, and `Page.pug` files in `src/views/[game]/`
- [ ] Create an entry file in `src/entries/` that imports and mounts your Vue component
- [ ] Register the entry in `vite.config.js`
- [ ] Add to `build-pages.js` and `watch-pages.js`
- [ ] Test in dev and production builds
- [ ] Add documentation in `docs/` (optional)
