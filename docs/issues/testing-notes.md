## Testing Notes

- 🚧 WORK IN PROGRESS! 🚧
- Expect some bugs. Also there's definitely some bad UI in here that needs to get addressed.
- UI will get cleaned up over time, but if you do stumble across some bugs, let me know.
- This is meant for DESKTOP, screens of like 1400 or wider. I will probably do a mobile version at some point, but that's a long way off.
- There are currently two ways the game ends: You can either die, or you can be shut down by the feds.
- I'd love for you to try to find both endings.
- The "Enable Debug" button will allow you access to cheats as well as some information you wouldn't be able to see otherwise.
