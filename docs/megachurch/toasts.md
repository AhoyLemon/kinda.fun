# Toast Rules (Kinda Fun Megachurch)

- Toasts summarize the most important audience reactions after each sermon.
- Only one toast per religion per sermon, showing the strongest reaction (like/dislike).
- Toasts prioritize religions with the highest number of likes or dislikes.
- Mixed message toasts appear if a tag or religion is both liked and disliked, limited to two per sermon.
- Toasts display the count of people affected and the cause (tag or religion).
- Toasts are shuffled for variety and limited to 10 per sermon.
- Donation toasts show the player's share and Sterling Silver's cut after all audience reactions.
- Toasts use timing delays for dramatic effect and never block gameplay.

Brevity, clarity, and emotional impact are prioritized in all toast messages.
