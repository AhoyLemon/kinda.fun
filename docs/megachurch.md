# MegaChurch Tycoon

MegaChurch Tycoon is a satirical religious empire-building game where you start with no money and a drug addiction, then use adaptable religious philosophy to build your way from street preaching to running a massive religious empire.

**Warning: This game contains mature themes including drug use, religious satire, and financial exploitation. It is intended as social commentary and parody.**

## How to Play

### Starting Out: Street Preaching

You begin as a broke street preacher with a spice addiction. Each day, you'll:

1. **Choose a Location** - Different neighborhoods have varying populations and religious demographics
2. **Craft Your Sermon** - Select three topics that will make up your daily message
3. **Preach to the Crowd** - Watch as different audience members react to your words
4. **Collect Donations** - Successful sermons earn money to fund your growing ministry

**Key Strategy Tips:**

- Match your sermon topics to the religious preferences of your location
- Avoid "mixed messages" - topics that both attract and repel the same religious group
- Your current spice level affects your charisma and preaching effectiveness

### Understanding Your Audience

**Locations Matter:** Each neighborhood has unique characteristics:

- **Population Size** - More people means bigger potential donations
- **Religious Demographics** - Different areas have concentrations of various faiths
- **Economic Level** - Wealthier areas provide larger donations

**Crafting Effective Sermons:**

- Choose **three topics** for each sermon from available themes
- Topics have **tags** that appeal to specific religious groups
- **Green reactions** mean your message resonates - expect donations!
- **Red reactions** show your message offends - they won't contribute
- **Mixed reactions** occur when the same person likes some topics but dislikes others

### The Spice System

**Your Addiction Challenge:**
You start the game addicted to "spice" - a street drug that affects your daily performance:

- **Withdrawal Effects** - Not having enough spice reduces your charisma and donation potential
- **Enhanced Performance** - The right amount of spice boosts your preaching abilities
- **Overdose Risk** - Too much spice can be dangerous or even fatal
- **The Plug** - Your dealer who provides spice for $5 per unit
- **Tolerance Growth** - Your addiction worsens over time, requiring more spice

### Building Your Empire

**From Streets to Sanctuary:**
As you earn money and build reputation, you'll unlock new opportunities:

**Uncle Harold's Van** ($2,000)

- Enables travel to new locations with different demographics
- Expands your preaching territory beyond your starting area

**Sterling Silver's Church Partnership**

- Transition from street preaching to running an actual church
- Sterling takes a cut of donations but provides a permanent venue
- Declare your church's religious affiliation
- Build **buzz** through successful sermons to increase attendance
- Your church develops a **Religious Scorecard** based on your past messages

**Church Revenue Streams:**

- **Sermon Donations** - Core income from engaged congregation members
- **Merchandise Sales** - Sell religious items to attendees for additional profit
- **Special Events** - Host breakfasts, talks, and community drives
- **Upgrades** - Purchase church improvements to boost attendance and donations

### End Game: Eternal Legacy

**Celebrity Friendships:**
In the later stages, you can use your wealth and influence to befriend celebrities, each providing unique benefits to your ministry. These relationships become part of your lasting legacy.

**Mammon - Your Final Score:**
The game will eventually end through various possible outcomes. **Mammon** represents your accumulated spiritual and material wealth - the ultimate measure of your religious empire's success or failure.

**Multiple Endings:**
Your choices throughout the game determine how your story concludes. Will you build a lasting religious legacy, or will your empire crumble under the weight of addiction and corruption?
