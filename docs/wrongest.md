# The Wrongest Words Game Documentation

## The Premise

The Wrongest Words is a party game about talking bollocks. In each round, you'll be given an untrue statement, and you'll try to convince others that your words are the least wrong.

## How to Play

Each round, every player will be dealt a card. Before you present, you'll be given a hint as to what's on your card. For example "There is no such thing as ... in America." Players go in order, and when it's your turn - push the button to start a timer.

It's now time for you to bullshit. In the time allowed, use whatever tactics you like to try to convince the other players of your statement. When your time ends, stop talking.

## Voting

When everyone has presented, it switches over to a vote. Each player will have to upvote the least wrong statement, and downvote the wrongest. This is based on whatever criteria each voter uses. Voting isn't rational!
