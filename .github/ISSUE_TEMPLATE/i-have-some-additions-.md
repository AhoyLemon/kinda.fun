## The Game

(Let's get this defined right away)

## Here's what I wanna add

Here, list everything you'd like to add. If you have multiple additions, please put them all in a single issue ticket.

For **Comparatively Famous**, your suggested celebrities must have an active Cammeo profile and some listed dollar value attached. Include a link to all celeb profiles.

For **This Meeting Has Points**, please include the exact phrase, and how many points it should be worth.

For **No More Billionaires**, you must link to the Forbes profile of that billionaire, showing their net worth.

For **Pretend World**, I need a page with at least one photo of the celebrity impersonator.
