# Dependabot configuration for kinda.fun
# This configuration prioritizes security updates and minimizes noise by:
# - Only creating PRs for security vulnerabilities
# - Grouping all updates into a single weekly PR
# - Ignoring minor/patch updates unless they fix vulnerabilities
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file
