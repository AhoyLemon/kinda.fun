# Dependabot configuration for kinda.fun
# This configuration minimizes noise by:
# - Checking for updates monthly (not weekly) to reduce frequency
# - Grouping all updates into a single PR on Monday
# - Limiting to 1 open PR at a time
# - Ignoring patch updates (only minor versions and security fixes create PRs)
